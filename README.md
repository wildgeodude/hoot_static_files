# Hoot

This repository hosts the static files for the [hoothq.com](https://hoothq.com) domain.

## How does Hoot work?
Hoot is a relatively simple browser extension.

It works a little bit like a website blocker. However in this case you the user have no control over which websites are blocked. The assumption is that if you've installed Hoot, you want all of this to be taken care of!

If you've got Hoot installed, when you navigate to a webpage the extension will use [this list](https://hoothq.com/symptom_checkers.json) of symptom checkers to work out whether to stop you in your tracks and prompt you to turn back.

## How to contribute

Pull requests for anything other than changes to `symptom_checkers.json` will be ignored and closed currently.

### What makes a good pull request?
Beyond your changes, it'd be useful to add some context.

Let's use an example where I want to add `https://example.com/symptom-checker` to the symptom checker file.

In my code changes I would add `https://example.com/symptom-checker/*` to the symptom checker file. Then in my pull request description I would also provide some notes detailing that although the main website is about health and wellness, we want to block access to any page under the `/symptom-checker` path.
