      <h1>Hoot</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Hoot homepage!</p>

      <h2>What is Hoot?</h2>
      <p>A browser extension aimed at helping anyone who wants to stop using symptom checkers.</p>

      <h2>Why did I build it?</h2>
      <p>Although I <strong>don't</strong> believe symptom checkers are entirely harmful, for me the negatives outweigh the positives.</p>
      <p>The mix of misinformation, worst case scenario thinking, and self-medication risks often makes visiting these websites a rather unpleasant and distressing experience.</p>
      <p>I thought I would try to make it more difficult for myself to research symptoms online, thereby reducing the chances that I'll end up worrying myself silly.</p>
      <p>The outcome was a fun couple of evenings hacking together something that ended up becoming Hoot.</p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>After Hoot is installed, if it detects that your current page is a symptom checker, you receive a (customizable) on-screen "hoot", prompting you to turn back.</p>

      <h2>Usage guide</h2>
      <p>TODO: instructions for installing the Chrome extension, then how to use hoot</p>

      <h2>Contribute to Hoot</h2>
      <p>There is a publicly visible list of symptom checker URLs used by Hoot to block certain webpages - you can <a target="_blank" href="https://wildgeodude.github.io/hoot_static_files/symptom_checkers.json">view it here</a>.</p>
      <p>Although this list is actively maintained, I encourage you to request the addition of any missing pages by doing either of the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Follow the instructions on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wildgeodude/hoot_static_files">this Github repo</a> to submit a pull request, or</li>
        <li>Reach out to me directly <a href="mailto:dominicsamphier@gmail.com">via email</a></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>Which browsers does it work on?</h3>
      <p>Only Google Chrome currently (my plan is to release it on other browsers, I only have so much time though!)</p>

      <h3>Why the owl theme?</h3>
      <p>Well, owls are great. But for the most part I wanted the on-screen "hoot" to constitute a voice of reason, and owls have long been associated with intelligence and wisdom.</p>

      <h3>Does it cost anything?</h3>
      <p>Nope.</p>
      <p>But if you like my work and want to say thanks or encourage me to create more, you can buy me a coffee!</p>
